# Echo

> "Echo," referring to the nymph from Greek mythology who had the power to repeat the words of others

## The concept

Press the main Echo button to enter a private room with another user. While in the room, you can only chat with that person; no one else.
Once either participant leaves the room, the two users can never be matched together again.
